Tools for simulating linguistic evolution

`Simuling` contains several small tools. The core is a simulation of
semantic change, using a bipartite model and a network of related
concepts. It also provides other tools useful for simulation studies
of language evolution inference, such as random tree generators,
wordlist sub-samplers and tree inference wrappers.
